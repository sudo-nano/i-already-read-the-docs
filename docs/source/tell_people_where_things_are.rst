Tell people where things are!
=============================

If you're asking a user to obtain a file, click a button, or change a setting,
tell them where it is! Pictures are best, but a written description is far better
than nothing. If you don't tell them where to find it, new users will be frustrated
and have to flounder for a long time before finding it.

**Poor Documentation:**
> Obtain the file and upload it.
> Change the X option to 10.

**Good Documenation:**
> Obtain the file from <location> and upload it.
> Change the X option, which can be found in the Y menu at the top left, to 10.
